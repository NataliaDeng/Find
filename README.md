Find is a program for users to find a specific place near them, e.g. Starbucks near them.
First run the index.js file, then open the corresponding web page, and the user could see a map showing the Starbucks restaurants around him. By clicking the button on the page the user could change to a list view showing the top-10 Starbucks restaurants that are near him.
